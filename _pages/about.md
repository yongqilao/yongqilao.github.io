Chinese-born cellist Dr. Yongqi Lao has performed across China, Europe, and the United States as a concerto soloist, chamber musician, and orchestral player. She recently relocated to the Bay Area, where she serves as a Teaching Artist at the Oakland Symphony and part of the Lecturer Pool at San Jose State University School of Music.

Dr. Lao completed her Doctor of Musical Arts in Cello Performance at Arizona State University under the mentorship of Tom Landschoot. Her research focuses on the adaptation of Chinese Southwestern folk music for Western string instruments, and recent performance highlights include the world premiere of Chen Yiâ€™s Three Bagatelles from China West (for cello and piano) in 2025. Prior to her doctoral studies, she completed a Master of Music in Cello Performance with a minor in vocal arts; a Performance Certificate in Cello Performance with minors in organ and piano; and a Bachelor of Arts in Music Education with an emphasis in piano.

With over a decade of teaching experience, Dr. Lao has worked with students ranging from elementary to collegiate levels. She gave her first solo concerto performance with orchestra at the age of 18. She is the recipient of numerous national academic and music scholarships, has participated in several international music festivals, recorded for Hollywood-produced motion pictures, and is frequently invited to serve on the faculty of international music festivals.
